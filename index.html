  <h1>Dhalsim</h1>
  <h2>This is the path to achieve enlightenment.</h2>
  <p>Dhalsim is a character from the fighting game franchise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter">Street Fighter</a>. He comes from India, and fights using his mastery of Yoga. His hallmark technique is stretching his limbs to lengths beyond that of a normal human in order to fight from afar. In addition to this, he can also levitate, blow fire, and even teleport from one place to another in the blink of an eye. Despite having these potentially devastating powers, he is a man of peace, and will avoid conflict unless he feels fighting is necessary to prevent great tragedy.</p>

  <p>Dhalsim's first appearance was in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_II:_The_World_Warrior">Street Fighter II</a> (1991), in which he is depicted as lean, bald (with painted red stripes on his head), and with pupilless eyes. He is humbly dressed in tattered yellow-brown shorts held by a simple cord belt, with like-colored wrist and ankle-wraps. He also wears large metal bracelets and anklets, hoop earrings, and is adorned with a necklace of three human skulls, making him quite spooky to behold. He has since been included as a playable character in many other games, the most recent being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_V">Street Fighter V</a> (2016), in which he dons a new look with a beard, turban, and extended body paint.</p>

  <p>It's safe to say Dhalsim is a bit of an oddball character, often favoring a mid to full-screen fight. Though it seems antithetic in a fighting game, he has the tools to make it work. Here's a video of professional fighting game player Filipino Champ putting in work with the stretchy Yoga master.
